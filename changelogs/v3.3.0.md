# Changelog - v3.3.0

## 🏗️ Architectural Milestone (Control vs. Data Plane Separation)
*   **Decoupled Architecture**: Formally separated the application into a **Data Plane** (`WeatherRepository`) and a **Control Plane** (`WeatherConnectionController`). 
*   **Data Plane**: Now exclusively manages sensor data processing, protocol parsing, and analytical trends. It is no longer responsible for *how* the device is connected.
*   **Control Plane**: Now exclusively manages connection lifecycles, Bluetooth hardware state, device discovery, and auto-reconnection logic.
*   **Clean Dependency Injection**: Refactored UseCases, ViewModels, and Services to inject only the planes they require, significantly improving maintainability and testability.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes & Improvements
*   **Test Suite Hardening**: Introduced `FakeWeatherConnectionController` and updated all unit and integration tests to verify the new plane separation.
*   **Service Optimization**: `WeatherService` now uses the Control Plane for connection management and the Data Plane for atomic heartbeat monitoring.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.3.0
*   **Version Code**: 61
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
