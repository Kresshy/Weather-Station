# Changelog - v3.1.4

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
*   **Trend Visibility**: Modified the analysis engine to always calculate and display temperature and wind speed trends, regardless of whether the Launch Detector is enabled. This ensures pilots always have visibility into air trends.
*   **Reconnect Dialog Fix**: Corrected a lifecycle issue where the reconnection prompt would not appear on startup after permission approval. The dialog now correctly triggers as soon as the app has the necessary authority to scan for devices.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.1.4
*   **Version Code**: 56
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
