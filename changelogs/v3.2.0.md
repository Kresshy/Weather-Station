# Changelog - v3.2.0

## 🏗️ Architectural Milestone (Single Heartbeat)
*   **Atomic Data Pipeline**: Refactored the core data flow to use a "Single Heartbeat" pattern. The repository now bundles raw weather data and calculated analytical trends into a single `ProcessedWeatherData` object.
*   **Guaranteed Synchronization**: Eliminated the risk of stale or out-of-sync UI values by ensuring that weather data and its corresponding trends (delta) are published and consumed as a single unit.
*   **Reduced UI Churn**: Fragments now receive exactly one update per second, significantly reducing the computational load on the UI thread and eliminating redundant chart plotting.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
*   **Trend Visibility Persistence**: Fixed the remaining issues where trends could appear static. They are now explicitly calculated and bundled with every weather data packet.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.2.0
*   **Version Code**: 59
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
