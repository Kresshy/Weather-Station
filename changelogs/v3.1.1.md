# Changelog - v3.1.1

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
*   **Overlay Text Persistence**: Fixed an issue where wind and temperature overlay text remained static in the `GraphViewFragment`. Both fragments now correctly update real-time values and trends.
*   **UI Resiliency**: Removed a redundant outlier rejection check in `DashboardFragment` that could cause the UI to "freeze" if values changed significantly after a long pause. Data validation is now handled exclusively by the repository.
*   **History Initialization**: Correctly populates overlay text and trends from historical data immediately upon fragment entry.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.1.1
*   **Version Code**: 53
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
