# Changelog - v3.3.2

## 🏗️ Architectural Refinement
*   **Standardized Naming**: Renamed `RawDataCallback` to `HardwareEventListener`. This more accurately reflects the interface's responsibility for handling both data packets and hardware connection lifecycle events.
*   **Clean API Design**: Standardized `setListener` and `listener` naming across the Control Plane and Data Plane boundaries.
*   **Code Quality**: Performed a final cleanup of orphaned methods and imports in the Repository and UseCase layers to ensure 100% architectural purity.

## 🧪 Testing
*   **Test Suite Synchronization**: Updated all unit tests (`ConnectionManagerTest`, `SimulatorConnectionTest`, `WeatherViewModelTest`, etc.) to align with the new interface names and dependency structures.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.3.2
*   **Version Code**: 63
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
