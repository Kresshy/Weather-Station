# Changelog - v3.1.5

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
*   **Restored Chart Scrolling**: Fixed a regression where charts would stop scrolling once the initial buffer was filled. The X-axis now increments correctly, and the viewport automatically follows the latest data points.
*   **Monotonic Timeline**: Implemented a point-counter system to ensure data integrity even when pruning old entries from memory.
*   **Viewport Management**: Correctly manages the visible range across fragment transitions, ensuring a seamless monitoring experience.

## 🛠️ Build Details
