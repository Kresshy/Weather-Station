# Changelog - v3.2.1

## 🎨 UI/UX & Visualization
*   **Linear Charting**: Removed Bezier curve smoothing from all charts. Data points are now connected with simple linear lines for a more direct and accurate representation of sensor readings.
*   **Initial Viewport Optimization**: Charts now initialize with the maximum allowed range (300 samples) immediately. This provides a consistent grid view from the moment the app is opened, rather than growing from zero.
*   **Dynamic Range Scaling**: Correctly transitions from a fixed initial view to a sliding window once the measurement history exceeds the visible buffer.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.2.1
*   **Version Code**: 60
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
