# Changelog - v3.0.6

## 🏗️ Architectural Milestone (Clean Architecture)
*   **UseCase Extraction**: Decoupled business logic from the repository into specialized components (`ConnectToDeviceUseCase`, `GetPairedDevicesUseCase`, etc.).
*   **Unified UI State (UDF)**: Transitioned to Uni-directional Data Flow, where fragments observe a single, immutable state object.
*   **Dagger Hilt**: Hardened dependency injection across the application, including injectable logging and random number generation for simulations.

## 🎨 UI/UX & Visualization
*   **Data Persistence**: Implemented a 300-sample historical buffer that persists across navigation, preventing chart resets.
*   **Dynamic Toolbar**: Added responsive toolbar heights and dynamic device name titles.
*   **High-Visibility Charts**: Upgraded to 5.0f line weights and 3.5f solid data points for field use.
*   **Signal Strength**: Added user-friendly labels (Excellent, Good, etc.) for RSSI values.

## 🛠️ Build Details
