*   **NavigationDelegate**: Centralizes the management of the Toolbar, Navigation Drawer, and Jetpack NavController, ensuring consistent UI behavior.
*   **UIEventDelegate**: Manages intermittent and persistent UI events such as the reconnection dialog and state-driven Snackbars.
*   **Atomic UI Updates**: Further stabilized the interaction between the Single Heartbeat pipeline and the newly delegated UI components.
