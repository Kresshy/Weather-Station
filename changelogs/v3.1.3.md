# Changelog - v3.1.3

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
*   **Atomic UI Updates**: Refactored fragments to use synchronized snapshots of the entire UI state. This ensures that weather data and its corresponding trend (delta) values are always displayed together, fixing the issue where trends remained static at +0.00.
*   **Data Sequencing**: Corrected the publication order in `WeatherRepositoryImpl` to ensure all analytical calculations (trends, scores) are ready before the weather heartbeat triggers a UI refresh.
*   **Unit Testing**: Expanded the test suite to specifically verify that asynchronous data updates from the repository eventually merge into a consistent UI state.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.1.3
*   **Version Code**: 55
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
