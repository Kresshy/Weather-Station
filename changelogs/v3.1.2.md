# Changelog - v3.1.2

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
*   **Real-time Trend Synchronization**: Fixed a race condition where trend values (delta changes) were not updating in the UI. Calculations are now guaranteed to complete before the UI state is notified.
*   **Protocol Robustness**: Hardened the legacy PDU parser to support mixed delimiters (space, comma, semicolon) while maintaining support for international decimal separators.
*   **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive unit tests for `GetWeatherUiStateUseCase` to prevent future regressions in UI data synchronization.

## 🛠️ Build Details
*   **Version Name**: 3.1.2
*   **Version Code**: 54
*   **Build Date**: February 21, 2026
